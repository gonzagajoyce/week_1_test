<h1>Hello World </h1>
<h2>My name is Joyce</h2>
<p>I’m starting to learn HTML and currently writing my first lines of code. I work in the sea freight import industry, but I'm now diving into coding with She Codes.</p> 
    
<p> After years working in sea freight logistics, I decided to explore a new passion: technology.
I’m learning how to code and building new skills—one line at a time.</p>

<p>This website is simple, but it means a lot—it's my first real project in web development.
I'm excited to keep growing and creating!</p>
